## Data
- Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claudiodavi/superhero-set

### The Data
- You will be working with a heavily modified version of the Superheroes dataset from Kaggle.

- The dataset includes two csv's:

[superhero_info.csv:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS1ZstYLwFgwhZnqDsPjtnlHYhJp_cmW55J8JD5mym0seRsaem3px7QBtuFF0LiI7z1PLCkVKAkdO7J/pub?output=csv)
    - Contains Name, Publisher, Demographic Info, and Body measurements.
    
[superhero_powers.csv:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSzdWOBaXOoz52vPmCFV5idNlDBohLY1Lsbc1IfZIZQ7cV_aNB2wYBfhF49uE1TaO1B5MQCGWiNrFfd/pub?output=csv)
    - Contains Hero name and list of powers

### The Task
- Your task is two-fold:

  1. Clean the files and combine them into one final DataFrame.

This dataframe should have the following columns:
- Hero (Just the name of the Hero)
- Publisher
- Gender
- Eye color
- Race
- Hair color
- Height (numeric)
- Skin color
- Alignment
- Weight (numeric)
- Plus, one-hot-encoded columns for every power that appears in the dataset. E.g.:
- Agility
- Flight
- Superspeed
    etc.

  2. Use your combined DataFrame to answer the following questions.

- Compare the average weight of super powers who have Super Speed to those who do not.
- What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?
